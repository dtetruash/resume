\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
I am a trilingual Computer Science student in my third semester at ETH. Over my years of life in Germany and Russia, as well as my bachelor studies in the United Kingdom, I have acquired an international perspective which lets me integrate easily into diverse teams. I have pursued computer science as a life-interest and a career since early middle school and began specializing in machine intelligence in particular slightly before beginning by bachelor studies at King’s College London (KCL). I am open and am easy to interact with and like to try myself with new things.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
I consider myself a good communicator; I pursue a career path in teaching. Until recently, I have been an active teaching assistant at KCL for three separate subjects with class sizes averaging 30 students, all under distinct supervisors. Additionally, I have served as a junior mathematics teacher at Harris Academy Peckham during an internship with TeachFirst. Finally, I have volunteered both as a programming and spoken language tutor throughout my undergraduate studies. These experiences back me up in communicating concisely and effectively, a skill which I can easily transition to the written text and social media.

Like many of my peers, I am extremely-online and therefore greatly digitally literate. I believe I possess the correct skill set to drive an engaging social media presence. What I add to this is being a proficient content creator. I am apt in the production of both image and video content, from ideation through production to the finished product. For example, my various event organizational roles (creation of posters, leaflets, etc.) as well as previous passion as a director/filmmaker support me in that regard. In particular, I would like to highlight my skill with image/video editing and creation software, such as the Adobe Suite. My previous roles in the positions of UI/UX Designer and Front-end Developer for projects such as \href{https://github.com/davzzar/clim-EX}{\underline{``Clim-EX''}} and \href{https://davzzar.github.io/prep-page/}{\underline{``Prep.''}} also reinforced those skills.

Throughout both my bachelor studies at KCL and my current student-career, I have had the joy to lead and organize many small group and personal projects to great success. I have also been a member of the Teaching Assistant and Student-Staff Liaison Committees at KCL. There, my duties included the organization of meetings and deliverables. Moreover, I have built a knack for organizing larger-scale events. Most recently, I have organized a 12-team sports tournament including team registrations, allocations, scheduling, location scouting, rules/regulations, safety, and of course prizes! Before then, I organized and hosted an award ceremony for my dorm of 160, complete with statuettes and award certificates. One of the largest events where I have played a big role in organizing was a familial celebratory event with c. 200 attendees.

\newpage

\lettersection{Why The AI Center?}
The AI Center offers a unique opportunity to engross oneself into the heart of AI research and collaboration at ETH. From my work here, I hope to gain new insights from peers and supervisors, as well as to hone in on my own research interests for my upcoming Master Thesis. Any future research undertakings at the ETH, I hope, will be enriched through a sort of osmosis which only being in a physical space which others more knowledgeable than oneself can provide. Aside from that, I seek to expand my ETH network, and a working with and alongside similarly interested people is a great way to achieve that. I find that a diverse, non-monotone day-to-day schedule is a work regime I enjoy. From my impressions, the position of Student Assistant would center around such a style and fulfil many of these hopes.
