% I am a striving trilingual ETH Computer Science Masters student with an international background. I am keen on deepening myself in the environment that ETH AI Center offers. Being a science communicator though my experiences of various teaching positions, I can deliver concepts, ideas, and information concisely. With skills in graphic design and video production, I hope to engage the AI Centerâ€™s audience with its outreach goals. Having organized several large celebratory and sports events, as well as small personal/group projects, I believe I am suitable in the role of a Student Assistant.

Having just finished my Autumn Semester examination session I am keen to apply myself in a semester project based in machine learning, computer vision and graphics, or (preferably) the intersection thereof. With the experience from previous courses as Physically-based Simulation, Computer Vision, and Advanced Machine Learning fresh in my working memory, as well as project other project experiences both at ETH and elsewhere, I look forward to work with you on our shared area of interest in this semester project.
